             <p>Cybersecurity is on the rise as we know, and it is 
                a highly technical field. Hard skills are important and you will need them to land a role. 
                Some skills you will need are <span class="types">networking fundamentals, operating systems, scripting and programming, 
                and cloud computing.</span> 
                <br>
                <br>
                Even though technical skills are required, you will need more. You will need to be able to 
                collaborate and communicate with others clearly, especially when working with a 
                team and explaining the technical aspects of the work to a non-computer <span class="wizard">wizard.</span> Verbal communication skills, 
                problem solving, and analytical skills are also needed.
