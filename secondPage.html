             <p class="second-paragraph"> What is a cyberattack? A cyberattack is an action designed to steal data,
                or change and destroy systems in a computer. As technology has advanced, cyberattacks have become 
                more prevalent as businesses have digitized leading to more enticing information to be attacked. </p>
<br>
The most common types of cyber attacks are:
<ol>
    <li><span class="attack">DoS (Denial of Service Attack)</span>: designed to overwhelm the resources of a system to the point where it is unable to reply to requests</li>
    <li><span class="attack">MITM (Man in the Middle)</span>: breaches in cybersecurity that make it possible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the data sent back and forth between two people, networks, or computers.</li>
    <li><span class="attack">Phishing Attacks</span>: a malicious actor sends emails that seem to be coming from trusted, legitimate sources in an attempt to grab sensitive information from the target.</li>
</ol>
