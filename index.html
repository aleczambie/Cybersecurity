             <p class="home-paragraph"><span class="first-word">Cybersecurity</span> covers a big range of topics, 
                but in general it is the practice of protecting systems, networks, 
                and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are aimed at 
                destroying, changing, and accessing the sensitive information and 
                can sometimes lead to extortion, all of which will interrupt business 
                operations. The problem with cybersecurity is that there are more devices 
                than people, so attackers are becoming more and more innovative. A successful cyberattack 
                is one that has layers and layers of security across the computers, 
                networks, and data that you want to keep safe. The best way to achieve this is 
                to have people, processes, and technology working together and complementing each other 
                to create a strong defense against cyberattacks.</p>
